# ansible-example

This is an example to show you how to use Ansible and Serverspec with [ansible_spec_plus](https://github.com/consort-it/ansible_spec_plus) to test roles,
hosts and playbooks and how to keep track ofyour code with simple resource coverge (test coverage).

## Dependencies and needed tools

1. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

2. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

3. Vagrant plugins:

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier
vagrant plugin install vagrant-share
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
vagrant plugin install vai
```

# Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/consort-it/ansible-example.git
```

## Start your SUT (subject under test)

Asssumed everything is installed correctly, you can proceed with:

```
cd ansible-example
vagrant status
```

```
ansible-example master ‚óè vagrant status
Current machine states:

demo                      not created (virtualbox)

The environment has not yet been created. Run `vagrant up` to
create the environment. If a machine is not created, only the
default provider will be shown. So if a provider is not listed,
then the machine is not created for that environment.
```

```
vagrant up demo
```

## Ensure your SUT is up and running

[http://10.100.100.200:9000](http://10.100.100.200:9000)

If you see 'UI For Docker, then your provisioning was successful.
